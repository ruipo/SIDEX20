# SIDEX20

Basic framework for analyzing SIDEX data:

1. Read in SIDEX data
2. Use sl_eSelect to detect transient events
3. Use loc_est_hyp to localize detected events and estimate propagation speed
4. Plot and tabulate results

If there is calibration data, analyze calibration data first to get an approximate estimate of the propagation speed.
